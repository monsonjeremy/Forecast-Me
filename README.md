#### Welcome to my ForecastMe. This is an open-source application for displaying the surf forecast. The app is currently in beta version and available at http://forecastme.io

#### If you are interested in running the app locally to develop or contribute:

#### First clone the Repo on to your local machine
#### Ensure you have docker installed (required)
- CD into the directory
```
cd repo-clone-dir-name
```
- Run the following
```
npm run docker:build:local
```
After those the containers are booted up the app will be available on port 3005, the server will be available on port 3006.

After those steps, the app can be accessed at localhost:3005

If you would like to make a PR, that would be awesome. Any new features are welcome.
