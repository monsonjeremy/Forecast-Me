## All Credit For Data and API goes to Surfline (new.surfline.com)

#### Welcome to my Web App that i'm currently in the process of building to provide a simple clean UI using Surfline's data for reading the surf forecast. 

#### Since the app has not been released yet, if interested in running the app please download the repository and do the following:
- CD into the directory
```
cd Forecast-Me
```
- Run NPM Install
```
npm install
```
- Run the app 
```
npm start
```

After those steps, the app can be accessed at localhost:3000
